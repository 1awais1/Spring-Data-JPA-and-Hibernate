# Spring Data JPA, Hibernate ORM, Docker, and PostgreSQL Example

This project is a demonstration of a web application developed using Spring Data JPA, Hibernate ORM, Docker, and PostgreSQL. These technologies combined provide a powerful framework for building scalable and efficient Java applications with database persistence.


## Key Features

    • CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing entities in a PostgreSQL database.
    • Integration with Hibernate ORM for efficient object-relational mapping and database interactions.
    • Utilization of Spring Data JPA repositories and entities for simplified data access and manipulation.
    • Dockerized application for containerized deployment, ensuring consistency and portability across environments.
    • Comprehensive unit and integration tests using JUnit, Spring Test, and Docker testing strategies.

## Technologies Used

    • Java 8+
    • Spring Boot
    • Spring Data JPA
    • Hibernate ORM
    • Docker
    • PostgreSQL
    • Maven
    • JUnit
    • Git (version control)


## Getting Started

#### Clone the repository to your local machine:

```http
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

 Configure database properties in src/main/resources/application.properties or src/main/resources/application.yml for PostgreSQL connection.
 Build and run the application using Maven:

```http
       mvn clean install
       mvn spring-boot:run
```
 Access the application endpoints to test CRUD operations and data retrieval.

## Deployment with Docker

    1. Install Docker on your machine if not already installed.
    2. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
       bashCopy code
       docker build -t myapp .
    3. Run the Docker container with PostgreSQL:
       bashCopy code
       docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name myapp-container myapp
    4. Access the application endpoints via the Docker container URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).


## Contributing
    1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
       bashCopy code
       git checkout -b feature/your-feature
    2. Make your changes and ensure that tests pass:
       bashCopy code
       mvn test
    3. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository:
       bashCopy code
       git commit -am 'Add new feature'
       git push origin feature/your-feature
    4. Submit a pull request detailing your changes for review.
